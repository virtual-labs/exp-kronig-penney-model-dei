      "question": "1. How does increasing the potential well depth affect the energy bands in the Kronig-Penney model?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It decreases the band gap width",
        "b": "It increases the number of energy bands",
        "c": "It increases the band gap width",
        "d": "It decreases the number of energy bands"

      "question": "2. According to Bloch's Theorem, the wavefunction in a periodic potential can be expressed as:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A linear function",
        "b": "A sinusoidal function",

    {
      "question": "3. What is the main physical reason why energy bands form in the Kronig-Penney model?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Electrons move randomly inside the crystal",
        "b": "The periodic potential creates constructive and destructive interference of electron waves",
        "c": "Electrons lose energy while moving in a lattice",
        "d": "Atoms compress the electrons into fixed energy levels"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Correct. Interference of electron wavefunctions in a periodic lattice leads to allowed and forbidden energy regions."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "4. What happens to the allowed energy band width when the spacing between potential barriers increases?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The allowed bands become narrower",
        "b": "The allowed bands become wider",
        "c": "The allowed bands disappear",
        "d": "The width remains completely unchanged"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Increasing spacing reduces wavefunction overlap, narrowing the allowed energy bands."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "5. In the Kronig-Penney model, what does the forbidden energy region (band gap) physically represent?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Energy values where electrons can freely move",
        "b": "Energy levels where electrons cannot exist",
        "c": "Energy levels occupied only by photons",
        "d": "Energy states with maximum stability"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Correct. Band gaps are energies at which no electron solutions exist in the periodic potential."
