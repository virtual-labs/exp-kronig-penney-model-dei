The aim of this experiment is to explore the Kronig-Penney model by simulating the behavior of electrons in a periodic potential. Through this simulation, participants will visualize how energy bands and band gaps form, understand the relationship between the periodic potential and electronic structure, and investigate the impact of varying potential parameters on electron wavefunctions and energy levels.
