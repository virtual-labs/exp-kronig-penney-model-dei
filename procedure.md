1.	### Initialize the Simulation:<br />
o	Open the simulation interface in your web browser. You will see a graphical canvas along with sliders for adjusting the potential depth and lattice spacing.<br />
2.	### Adjust Parameters:<br />
o	Use the Potential Depth Slider to set the depth of the potential wells. As you move the slider, the value displayed next to it will update accordingly.<br />
o	Use the Lattice Spacing Slider to adjust the distance between potential wells. This will also update the value displayed next to the slider.<br />
3.	### Visualize the Periodic Potential:<br />
o	The simulation will automatically display the periodic potential wells as green vertical lines or rectangular barriers on the canvas.<br />
o	Observe how the potential wells are structured and how they repeat across the canvas.<br />
4.	### Analyze Energy Bands:<br />
o	The simulation will draw horizontal blue lines to represent energy bands. These lines indicate the allowed energy levels for electrons within the periodic potential.<br />
o	Notice how the number and position of these bands change with different potential depth and lattice spacing settings.<br />
5.	### Examine Electron Wavefunctions:<br />
o	The simulation will also display electron wavefunctions as red sine waves. These curves show how electrons behave within the potential wells.<br />
o	Adjust the sliders to see how changes in potential depth and lattice spacing affect the wavefunctions.<br />
6.	### Explore the Effects of Parameter Changes:<br />
o	Modify the potential depth and lattice spacing using the sliders to explore their effects on the energy bands and wavefunctions.<br />
o	Observe how increasing or decreasing these parameters alters the formation of energy bands and the characteristics of electron wavefunctions.<br />
7.	### Draw Conclusions:<br />
o	Based on your observations, analyze how the periodic potential influences the energy bands and wavefunctions.<br />
o	Relate your findings to concepts such as band gaps, the behavior of conductors, semiconductors, and insulators.<br />
8.	### Document Your Findings:<br />
o	Take notes on how different parameter values affect the system. Pay attention to any patterns or insights you gain about the relationship between the periodic potential and electronic properties.<br />
