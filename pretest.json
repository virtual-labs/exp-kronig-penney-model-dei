      "question": "3. In the Kronig-Penney model, what causes the formation of allowed and forbidden energy bands?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Random arrangement of atoms",
        "b": "Periodic potential experienced by electrons",
        "c": "High temperature of the crystal",
        "d": "Electric current passing through the metal"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Correct. The periodic potential leads to standing waves for electrons, creating allowed and forbidden bands."

      "question": "4. What happens to the band gap if the potential barrier height is increased in the Kronig-Penney model?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The band gap decreases",
        "b": "The band gap becomes zero",
        "c": "The band gap increases",
        "d": "The band gap remains constant"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Correct. Higher barriers increase electron confinement, widening the band gap."

      "question": "5. Which of the following best explains why metals conduct electricity according to the Kronig-Penney model?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "They have very large band gaps",
        "b": "The valence band is completely filled",
        "c": "The conduction band overlaps with the valence band",
        "d": "Electrons have zero mass"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Correct. Overlapping bands allow electrons to move freely, making metals good conductors."
